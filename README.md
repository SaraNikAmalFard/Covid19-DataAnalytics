### Project overview

This is a Data Analytics project consisting in identifying a dataset of our choice and apply Machine Learning algorithms to it based on objectives and predictions we want to verify. Linked to all these Python 3 Jupyter notebooks is our mini conference paper detailing:
1.  Problem statement and hypothesis.
2.  Description of your dataset and how it was obtained.
3.  Description of any data pre-processing steps taken.
4.  What was learned from exploring the data, including visualisations.
5.  How features for analysis were chosen.
6.  Details of the modelling process, including how the data analytic methods were selected, as well as the model validation.
7.  Challenges and successes.
8.  Key findings.
9.  Possible extensions or business applications of your project.
